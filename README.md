Immunefi wants to resolve the trust issue that currently exists in bug bounty programs by creating a decentralized
version of the bounty programs we currently run on our “Web2” infrastructure. This protocol provides a way for projects
to lock collateral for bug bounties to further incentivize hackers to review their projects.

## High level description

A project can prove their proof of capital deploying a vault via Immunefi Dashboard and depositing capital. The project
is the ultimate owner of the vault, none else can access or operate their funds. The protocol is non custodial.

Currently a vault is implemented as a [Gnosis Safe](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-contracts).

A project pays a successful report submission by a whitehat using the [Splitter](./src/Splitter.sol). This contract
handles automatically the distribution of the bounty payment to the whitehat and the Immunefi protocol fee.

This is an MVP and up to changes in the next iterations.
